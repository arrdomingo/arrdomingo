# how to change github account in terminal?

> While pushing my code, I got an error:
- remote: Permission to `username1`/repo.git denied to `username2`.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/username1/repo.git/':
The requested URL returned error: 403

- WHERE: 
- `username1` is `arrdomingo` which is my `PROFESSIONAL GITHUB ACCOUNT`
- `username2` is `snowman07` which is my `PERSONAL GITHUB ACCOUNT`

> Error occur because I initially used my personal github account (snowman07) for pushing codes and stuff in my local machine. Now, I need to use my professional github account. Below are the references I used to solve the error. My problem solved basically by `deleting personal github account in Credential Manager`
